### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge, and as a person who is just starting with frontend web development, I learnt a lot about creating and styling HTML documents. I learnt how to write semantic HTML and using divs to manage and contain content, and I learned various different layout and styling properties in CSS.

This project also enabled me to further increase my understanding of the Box Model in HTML and how box-sizing affects the behaviour of different elements, and I look forward to understanding and getting comfortable with it more in the future!

I couldn't implement a responsive mobile design as of now, but that will surely be something I'll be working onto next.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This site really helped me in experimenting with and generating the box-shadow styling for the QR Code card. I really liked this website as it helps you visually experiment and see different box-shadows and I will be using it going forward.
